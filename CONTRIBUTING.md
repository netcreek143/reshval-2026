Collaborating Guidelines
This is an OPEN Open Source Project.

What?
Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.

Rules
There are a few basic ground rules for collaborators:

No --force pushes or modifying the Git history in any way.
Non-master branches ought to be used for ongoing work.
External API changes and significant modifications ought to be subject to an internal pull request to solicit feedback from other collaborators.
Internal pull requests to solicit feedback are encouraged for any other non-trivial contribution but left to the discretion of the contributor.
Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing code style.
Releases
Declaring formal releases remains the prerogative of the project maintainer.

Changes to this arrangement
This is an experiment and feedback is welcome! This document may also be subject to pull requests or changes by collaborators where you believe you have something valuable to add or change.
