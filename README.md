## 🚀 How to Make This Yours

You don't need to be a coding wizard. I built this to be easily customizable for *everyone*.

### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EuclidStellar/valentine-protocol.git
cd valentine-protocol
npm install
```

### 2. Customize `src/config.js`
Open `src/config.js` and edit the values. It's that simple.

```javascript
const config = {
    person: {
        name: "Her Name", 
        nickname: "Player 2",
    },
    audio: {
        // Drop your mp3s in src/assets/audio and link them here!
        rose: roseAudio, 
    },
    messages: {
        rose: {
            success: "You make my heart bloom!" // Your custom text
        }
    }
};
```

### 3. Deploy
Run `npm run build` and upload the `dist` folder to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop). Or use Vercel for one-click deployment.
